                  also shouldn’t try to translate the app into other languages, or make derivative versions. The app

                <p class="gr-text-9">INDEX Myanmar Tech Studio is committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and
                  efficient as possible. For that reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge
                  for its services, at any time and for any reason. We will never charge you for the app or its services

                <p class="gr-text-9">The AKT Channel app stores and processes personal data that you have provided to
                  us, in order to provide our Service. It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the app
                  secure. </p>
                <p class="gr-text-9">We therefore recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the
                  process of removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating system of
                  your device. It could make your phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise
                  your phone’s security features and it could mean that the AKT Channel app won’t work properly or at
                  all.</p>

                <p class="gr-text-9">You should be aware that there are certain things that INDEX Myanmar Tech Studio
                  will not take responsibility for. Certain functions of the app will require the app to have an active
                  internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided by your mobile network provider, but
                  INDEX Myanmar Tech Studio cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full functionality if
                  you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any of your data allowance left.</p>
                <p class="gr-text-9">If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that
                  your terms of the agreement with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may
                  be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while
                  accessing the app, or other third party charges.</p>
                <p class="gr-text-9">In using the app, you’re accepting responsibility for any such charges, including
                  roaming data charges if you use the app outside of your home territory (i.e. region or country)
                  without turning off data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which you’re using
                  the app, please be aware that we assume that you have received permission from the bill payer for
                  using the app.</p>
                <p class="gr-text-9">Along the same lines, INDEX Myanmar Tech Studio cannot always take responsibility
                  for the way you use the app i.e. You need to make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out
                  of battery and you can’t turn it on to avail the Service, INDEX Myanmar Tech Studio cannot accept
                  responsibility.</p>
                <p class="gr-text-9">With respect to INDEX Myanmar Tech Studio’s responsibility for your use of the app,
                  when you’re using the app, it’s important to bear in mind that although we endeavour to ensure that it
                  is updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties to provide information to us so that
                  we can make it available to you.</p>
                <p class="gr-text-9">INDEX Myanmar Tech Studio accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect,
                  you experience as a result of relying wholly on this functionality of the app. At some point, we may
                  wish to update the app. The app is currently available on Android & iOS – the requirements for both
                  systems(and for any additional systems we decide to extend the availability of the app to) may change,
                  and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep using the app.</p>
                <p class="gr-text-9">INDEX Myanmar Tech Studio does not promise that it will always update the app so
                  that it is relevant to you and/or works with the Android & iOS version that you have installed on your
                  device.</p>
                <p class="gr-text-9">However, you promise to always accept updates to the application when offered to
                  you, We may also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of it at any time without
                  giving notice of termination to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the
                  rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must stop using the app, and (if
                  needed) delete it from your device.</p>
